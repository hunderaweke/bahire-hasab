## Description
- This is a python Installation module for Ethiopian Calender method for determining the dates of lents and holidays or in Amharic Bahire Hassab ·â£·àÖ·à® ·àê·à≥·â•
- I have used the native calculation method If you want the book I used you can find it [](#)
- Each of the names I used in the module is mostly the Amharic Equivalent of the holiday if you want all you can get it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e7AukagokWlEiuz_0YtZ8Oz3RcUoQaLC/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Click Here!</a>.

## Documentation
- There is a snippet how to use it for your personal projects
```python
from bahire_hasab import BahireHasab
from detetime import detetime
# The year according to the Ethiopian Calender
year = datetime.now().year -8
bh = BahireHasab(year)
eth_easter = bh.tnsae
print(eth_easter)# ·àö·ã´·ãö·ã´ 8 this is for the Ethiopian year 2015
# This is should print the date of the Ethiopian Easter according to the Ethiopian Calendar
